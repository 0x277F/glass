Glass
=====
*"The Worst Bouncer"â„¢*

Glass is a simple proxy server for IRC. I wrote it to try and supplement 
Quassel's lack of extensibility as a client. In the interest of not duplicating
Quassel's functionality, Glass doesn't provide bouncer features such as
persistent connections or backlog storage. I sincerely doubt anyone else will
find this useful, but have fun.
